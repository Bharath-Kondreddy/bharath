JAVA SCRIPT VARIABLES
----------------------
4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:
>>Using var
>>Using let
>>Using const
>>Using nothing

NOTE: Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values)

When to Use JavaScript var?
If you want your code to run in older browser, you must use var.
The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

When to Use JavaScript const?
If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.

If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.
NOTES:
>>Just like in algebra, variables hold values.
>>Just like in algebra, variables are used in expressions.
-------------------------------
JAVASCRIPT IDENTIFIERS

>>All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
>>These unique names are called identifiers.
>>Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

NOTES:
-}Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
-}Names must not begin with Digits.
-}Names are case sensitive.
-}Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

//In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.
The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript//

JAVASCRIPT DATA TYPES

JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values(STRINGS) like "John Doe".
>>Strings are written inside double or single quotes.
>>Numbers are written without quotes.

Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
You declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword.

After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is undefined).
To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign"="

NOTE:It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the 	beginning of a script.
---------------------
RE-DECLARING JAVASCRIPT VARIABLES

If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.
NOTE:>>You cannot re-declare a variable declared with "let" or "const"
>>These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
>>Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block.

>>Variables declared with the "var" keyword can NOT have block scope.

>>Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.
-------
REDECLARING
>>Redeclaring a JavaScript variable with var is allowed anywhere in a program.
>>With let, redeclaring a variable in the same block is NOT allowed.
>>Redeclaring a variable with let, in another block, IS allowed.
>>When "var" keyword  is used, you can use the variable before it is declared.
-}Variables defined with let are also hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.

-}Meaning: Using a "let" variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError
------------------
JAVASCRIPT "Const"

The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).

Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.

Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.

Variables defined with const have Block Scope.

>>JavaScript "const" variables must be assigned a value when they are declared.
>>JavaScript "const" variables must be assigned a value when they are declared.

WHEN TO USE JAVASCRIPT "Const"?
>>As a general rule, always declare a variable with const unless you know that the value will change.

-}Use const when you declare:

A new Array
A new Object
A new Function
A new RegExp

NOTE:It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.
