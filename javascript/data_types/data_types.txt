JAVASCRIPT DATA TYPES

JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values(STRINGS) like "Bharath Reddy".
>>Strings are written inside double or single quotes.
>>Numbers are written without quotes.
>>Numbers can be written with, or without decimals

JavaScript has dynamic types. 
This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types
-------------
JS BOOLEANS

>>Booleans can only have two values: true or false.
>>Booleans are often used in conditional testing.
------------------------------

THE "typeof" OPERATOR
You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable.

The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression.
--------------------------
UNDEFINED
In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.
Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. The type will also be undefined.
----------------------
EMPTY VALUES
An empty value has nothing to do with undefined.

An empty string has both a legal value and a type.
