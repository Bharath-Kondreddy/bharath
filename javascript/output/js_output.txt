JAVASCRIPT DISPLAY POSSIBILITIES
--------------------------------
JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

>Writing into an HTML element, using "innerHTML".
>Writing into the HTML output using "document.write()".
>Writing into an alert box, using "window.alert()".
>Writing into the browser console, using "console.log()".
-----
USING "innerHTML"
-}To access an HTML element, JavaScript can use the 	"document.getElementById(id name)" method.

-}The "id" attribute defines the HTML element. The "innerHTML" property defines the HTML content

NOTE:Changing the innerHTML property of an HTML element is a common way 	to display data in HTML.
-----
USING "document.write()"
For testing purposes, it is convenient to use "document.write()"

NOTE:	1)Using "document.write()" after an HTML document is loaded, 		will delete all existing HTML
	2)The "document.write()" method should only be used for 	testing.
