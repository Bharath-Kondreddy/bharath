			STRINGS
			-------

JS strings are for storing and manipulating text.

JS string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.

ESCAPE CHARACTER
-----------------
Because strings must be written within quotes, JavaScript will misunderstand this string:

Ex:
	let text = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.";
Note:The string will be chopped to "We are the so-called ".

	>The solution to avoid this problem, is to "use the backslash escape character".

	>The backslash (\) escape character turns special characters into string characters:

Code		Result		Description
\'			'			Single quote
\"			"			Double quote
\\			\			Backslash
