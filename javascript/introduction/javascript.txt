JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
--------------------------------------------------
DID YOU KNOW?
>JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.

>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.

>ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.
---------------------------------
JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

   1. HTML to define the content of web pages

   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages

   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages
---------------
JavaScript Can Change HTML Content
	>One of many JavaScript HTML methods is getElementById().
JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS)
JavaScript Can Hide HTML Elements
	>Hiding HTML elements can be done by changing the _display_ 		style using "none" value
JavaScript Can Show HTML Elements
	>Showing hidden HTML elements can also be done by changing the 	_display_ style using "block" value


NOTE:	1)JavaScript accepts both double and single quotes
9676400741
	2)Old JavaScript examples may use a type attribute: <script 	type="text/javascript">.
	The type attribute is not required. JavaScript is the default 	scripting language in HTML.
-------------------------------------
--}The <script> Tag
In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.
--------------------
JavaScript Functions and Events
A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.

For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.
--------------------
--}JavaScript in <head> or <body>
You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.

Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
---------------------
--}JavaScript in <head>
In this example, a JavaScript function is placed in the <head> section of an HTML page.

The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked
----------------------
NOTE:Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display.
---------------------------
--}External JavaScript
>Scripts can also be placed in external files.

>External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.

>To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag.

>You can place an external script reference in <head> or <body> as you like.

>The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the <script> tag is located.

NOTE:	External scripts cannot contain <script> tags.
----------------------
EXTERNAL JAVA SCRIPT ADVANTAGES:

-}It separates HTML and code
-}It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
-}Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads

NOTE:To add several script files to one page  - use several script tags
