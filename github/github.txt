What is Version Control system?
-------------------------------

>VCS is also known as revision control, source control, or source code management.
>Just like an app has different updates due to bugs and additional feature addition, version changes, git also supports this feature. >Many developers can add their code in parallel.
>So the version control system easily manages all the updates that are done previously.
>Git provides the feature of branching in which the updated code can be done, and then it can be merged with the main branch to make it available to the users. 
>It not only makes everything organized but keeps synchronization among the developers to avoid any mishap.
